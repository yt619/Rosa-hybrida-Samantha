The assembly method for the genome of modern tetraploid rose.
In this study, the haplotype-resolved tetraploid genome of modern rose was assembled using the Pore-C technology.
Due to the complex ancestral origins of modern roses, which result in a segmental allotetraploid genome characteristic among the chromosomes, correctly phasing between homologous chromosomes is challenging using only Hi-C technology. The Pore-C technology was utilized for precise orientation between homologous chromosomes to reduce assembly errors.
